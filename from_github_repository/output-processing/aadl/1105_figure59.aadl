  -- systems, output data and indicators to other flight systems and display
  -- Show DurationDistribution property for recover event
features
  current_air_speed: in data port;  -- from ADC

  fc_error_recovery: out data port;  -- to pilot, copilot MFD
  --  Top level flight controller error model
